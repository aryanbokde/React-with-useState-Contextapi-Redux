                        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content thatâ€™s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>

                        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
                        <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
                        <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
                        <blockquote className="blockquote">
                            <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>

                        <h3>Example lists</h3>
                        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First list item</li>

                            <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
                        <pre><code>Example code block</code></pre>
                        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout.</p>
